[Updated 1/19] Networking Project
By: Trevor, Will, Kyler, Lucy [TWKL]
Preface:
This is NOT a step-to-step tutorial but rather documents our thought process, changes, problems, and failures that we have encountered when working on this project. 

We used the computer that was previously used for Virtual Reality gaming, and transformed it into a CTF server with:
- An Ubuntu Server operating system
- RAID 10 for redundant CTF storage
- Docker

Why this project:
The overall arching goal of this project is to understand how to build a web server

Primary Materials: 
- Cisco Business CBS350-8T-E-2G Managed Switch - amazon
- 4 SSDâ€™s -  crucial	
- Usb to Ethernet Console Cable x3 - amazon
- More Mounting Brackets
- Coursera PC
- More drives to make it a server
- More RAM
- CTF platform: host on our server + make new challenges

Project Plan
Using the materials, we will set up the server
Figure out the OS - on Linux
When hosting the CTF platform
Consider multipurpose uses (file shares)
Help from Mr. Steiner, etc.
Use cybercup github repo
Post on LinkedIn the final result
