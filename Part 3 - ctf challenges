used https://github.com/mdulin2/SC4 to transfer CTF challenges from last year to prepare the Cybersecurity class in competing in Cyber Cup 2024

Decided on flag syntax, sent out CTF challenge assignments 

 configuring docker to run on start
21) put command that runs docker into a script to reference in crontab
22) configure challenge to run when link is clicked, messing around with ports
65223 for cats, assign different port for every challenge
